Logic : include and exclude 

class Solution {
public:
    void helper(vector<int>& nums,int idx,vector<int>& op,vector<vector<int>>& res)
    {
       //base case
       if(idx>=nums.size())
       {
         res.push_back(op);
         return;
       }

       //include case
       op.push_back(nums[idx]);
       helper(nums,idx+1,op,res);
       //backtrack
       op.pop_back();

       //exclude case
       helper(nums,idx+1,op,res);
    }
    vector<vector<int>> subsets(vector<int>& nums) 
    {
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        vector<int> op;
        helper(nums,0,op,res);
        return res;

Time Complexity
“For each element, I have two choices — either include it in the subset or exclude it.
So the recursion forms a binary tree where each level corresponds to one element.”

Number of elements = n

Total subsets generated = 2ⁿ

“Every time I reach the base case, I store the current subset.
Copying that subset takes O(n) time in the worst case.”
Time Complexity is O(n × 2ⁿ)

1️⃣ Recursive stack + temporary vector

“The recursion depth goes up to n, and the temporary subset vector also stores up to n elements.”

Auxiliary space = O(n)

2️⃣ Result storage

“Since we store all 2ⁿ subsets and each subset can take up to n space,
the result storage is O(n × 2ⁿ).
